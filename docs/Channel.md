# Channel

Describes a power meter channel.  The General channel provides continuous power - it's the channel all of your appliances and lights are attached to.  Controlled loads are only on for a limited time during the day (usually when the load on the network is low, or generation is high) - you may have your hot water system attached to this channel.  The feed in channel sends power back to the grid - you will have these types of channels if you have solar or batteries.
